    <h1>Claim</h1>
    <p>I do not think a straight, long tube is in the mystery box.</p>
    <h1>Evidence</h1>
    <p>We were investigating the mystery black box, a black box that has a funnel at the top, a tube coming out of it and an unknown inside. We tested the mystery box by pouring 500 mL in the top and seeing how much water came out. Sometimes, no water came out, sometimes a little more water came out, and other times, a lot more water came out. For example, when 500 mL of water was poured out, 1915 mL came out. After many tests, we tried to create out own black box. First, we cut out a hole at the top and attached a tube to the funnel that went through the inside of the box and came out through another hole that was made at the bottom of the box. When we tested it, everytime we put 100 mL of water in the funnel, the same amount came out. For example, when we put 100 mL of water, 100 mL came out.</p>
    <h1>Reasoning</h1>
    <h3>Part I</h3>
    <p>A model is a smaller or bigger version of an object that shows all of the main parts of the object and how the model functions. Models are useful because they can help you understand or picture something that you might not be able to with the real machine. One limitation of models is that it might not be precise because the model might show that the machine works, but the real machine might only work once.</p>
    <h3>Part II</h3>
    <p>My evidence supports my claim I made because the original black box had different results than the black box I made. When I made a model of the black box, whatever amount I put in, that exact amount came out. With the black box, whatever amount was inputted, that exact amount never came out.</p>
    <h3>Part III</h3>
    <p>If there is a straight, long tube in the mystery black box, then anytime I put an amount of water in the mystery black box, that exact amount would come out. For example, if 500 mL was poured in, 500 mL would come out, but this is not true for the real mystery black box. This is why my claim is correct.</p>
